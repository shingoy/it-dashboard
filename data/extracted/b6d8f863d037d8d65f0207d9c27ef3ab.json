Under the SBIR program, two types of grants are awarded: “Specific New Technology Grants” and “Designated Grants.” 1) Specific New Technology Grants Specific New Technology Grants refer to the grants and commissioned funds for research and development within each ministry or agency, which include research and development-type startups as eligible recipients.
